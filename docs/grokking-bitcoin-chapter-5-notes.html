<h1>Study Notes: Chapter 5 – Transactions</h1>

<!-- 1. OVERVIEW & PROBLEMS -->
<h2>1. Overview & Motivations</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q1: Why did the system need to replace the old “email to Lisa” approach with transactions?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  Because in the old approach, only Lisa saw the email requests, giving her 
  the power to modify entries and potentially steal. Transactions store 
  signatures and payment details publicly, so everyone can verify they haven’t 
  been altered, reducing trust required in Lisa.
</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q2: What key problems do transactions solve?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  <ul>
    <li>They let the system handle multiple coins and recipients in a single payment 
        (more efficient than multiple spreadsheet rows).</li>
    <li>All signatures become public, so anyone can audit the ledger and detect tampering.</li>
    <li>They enable flexible “programmable money” with <em>scripts</em>, 
        accommodating multi-signature or other advanced features.</li>
  </ul>
</p>


<!-- 2. WHAT IS A TRANSACTION? -->
<h2>2. What Is a Transaction?</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q3: How does a transaction replace the old “From, To, CT” approach?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  A transaction includes <em>inputs</em> (referencing specific previously unspent outputs) 
  and <em>outputs</em> (new “coins” created by the transaction). Each output specifies 
  a script that must be satisfied to spend it. This formalizes and records 
  the payment, and can’t be changed without invalidating the signatures.
</p>

<div class="figure">
  <img src="images/ch05/05-04.svg" alt="05 04" width="75%">
  <div class="figure-caption">
    Figure 4. Example transaction with two inputs (two UTXOs) and two outputs (the actual payment + change).
  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q4: Why do we often have a “change output”?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  Because outputs in Bitcoin-like systems must be spent entirely. If you only 
  need 8 out of a 10 “coin” output, you’ll consume the whole 10 in your transaction 
  and create one output for 8 (the payment) plus one for 2 (change) going back to you.
</p>

<p class="question">
  Q5: Where does Lisa store these new transactions?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  In the shared ledger (the “spreadsheet”). Each confirmed transaction is appended 
  exactly as created by the sender, ensuring full transparency and auditability.
</p>


<!-- 3. CREATING AND CONFIRMING TRANSACTIONS -->
<h2>3. Creating and Confirming Transactions</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q6: How is a transaction created and confirmed?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Create</strong> – The wallet gathers inputs (previous unspent outputs), 
        calculates total value, adds outputs (payment + change), 
        then signs each input with the relevant private key.</li>
    <li><strong>Confirm</strong> – Lisa (or a node) checks references to ensure 
        they exist and aren’t already spent, verifies signatures, and if valid, 
        appends the transaction to the ledger.</li>
    <li><strong>Verify</strong> – Anyone can re-check the transaction in the ledger 
        for correctness, ensuring Lisa hasn’t tampered with it.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<div class="figure">

  <div class="figure-caption">

  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q7: What is the UTXO set, and why is it useful?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  The UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) set is a list of all currently spendable outputs. 
  It allows quick checks to confirm that a transaction’s inputs are valid and 
  unspent, avoiding full balance calculations for each PKH.
</p>


<!-- 4. SCRIPTING CAPABILITY -->
<h2>4. The Script Language</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q8: Why is there a <em>programmable</em> aspect in each transaction output?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  Each output holds a small script (the <em>pubkey script</em>) dictating how 
  it can be spent. The input that spends it provides the matching script data 
  (the <em>signature script</em>). If the combined script checks out (returns <code>OK</code>), 
  the spending is authorized.
</p>

  <img src="images/ch05/05-10.svg" alt="05 10" width="75%">
  <div class="figure-caption">
    Figure 10. The spending input must provide the correct public key and signature to match the PKH in the output script.
  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q9: How do multi-signature transactions work?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  Instead of “pay-to-public-key-hash,” you can use <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIG</code> and 
  require M-of-N signatures from multiple participants, which is great for 
  shared accounts or more secure storage.
</p>

  <div class="figure-caption">

  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q10: What if the recipient’s script is large, but the sender doesn’t want to pay the higher fee for a bigger output script?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  They can use <strong>pay-to-script-hash (p2sh)</strong>, which hides the actual script behind a 
  script hash. The sender only sees and pays to the short hash, while the 
  detailed script is provided (and paid for in bytes) by whoever later spends it.
</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q11: How can we identify a p2sh address?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  p2sh addresses (base58check with version byte 0x05) typically start with <code>3</code> 
  (e.g., <code>3ABC...</code>), distinguishing them from p2pkh addresses (which start with <code>1</code>).
</p>


<!-- 5. TRANSACTIONS AND COIN CREATION -->
<h2>5. Coinbase & Money Creation</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q12: If all money is tracked in unspent outputs, how does new money enter the system?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  Through a special <em>coinbase transaction</em>, which has a special input (“coinbase”) 
  and no previous txid. This transaction can create new funds for Lisa (or miners in Bitcoin) 
  as a reward for maintaining the ledger.
</p>

</div>


<!-- 6. TRUST REMAINING IN LISA -->
<h2>6. What Trust Remains in Lisa?</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q13: Can Lisa still cheat if all transactions are publicly verified?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  She can’t forge or alter individual transactions without invalidating signatures. 
  However, she can still:
  <ul>
    <li>Refuse to confirm (censor) certain transactions</li>
    <li>Potentially remove (“revert”) past transactions from the ledger</li>
  </ul>
  This undermines confidence but can’t be easily proven by new verifiers. 
  Later chapters (like blockchains, proof of work) will fix this.
</p>


<!-- 7. KEY TAKEAWAYS / SUMMARY -->
<h2>7. Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Transactions</strong> replace the old single row of “From, To, CT.” 
      They have <em>inputs</em> (which UTXOs are being spent) and <em>outputs</em> (who receives how much).</li>
  <li>Everyone can verify transactions because they include all necessary signatures and scripts. 
      This drastically reduces trust in Lisa—she can’t secretly alter payments.</li>
  <li><strong>UTXO set</strong>: Lisa (and any full verifier) maintains a list of unspent outputs 
      for fast checks of double spending.</li>
  <li><strong>Script:</strong> A flexible, minimal programming language for specifying spending conditions. 
      Basic form is p2pkh, but more advanced forms include multisig (<code>OP_CHECKMULTISIG</code>) or 
      p2sh (pay-to-script-hash).</li>
  <li><strong>New addresses:</strong> p2sh addresses start with <code>3</code>, hiding the script until spending time.</li>
  <li>Coinbase transactions are how new money enters the system (replacing the old daily “row for Lisa”).</li>
  <li>Lisa can’t forge or alter transactions, but she can still censor or revert them, 
      which future chapters address with the concept of a blockchain and distributed consensus.</li>
</ul>

publicly verifiable payments, forming the basis for the trustless 
Bitcoin system once the blockchain is introduced!</em></p>
