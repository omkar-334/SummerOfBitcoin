    <!-- 1. INTRODUCTION TO BITCOIN -->
    <h2>1. What is Bitcoin and Why Does It Matter?</h2>

    <p class="question">
        Q1: How would you describe Bitcoin in simple terms?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        Bitcoin is a digital cash system that lets people transfer value (called
        <strong>bitcoins</strong>) directly to one another over the internet, without
        relying on banks or governments. It’s “peer-to-peer” money, meaning no central
        authority is in charge.
    </p>

    <p class="question">
        Q2: What do we mean by "<em>Bitcoin network</em>"?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        The Bitcoin network is made up of thousands of computers (known as
        <strong>nodes</strong>) around the world. These nodes run Bitcoin software
        and collectively verify, process, and record all Bitcoin transactions.
    </p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="question">
        Q3: Does anyone control or own Bitcoin?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        No single entity controls Bitcoin. It is <strong>decentralized</strong>, meaning
        no individual government, company, or person dictates its rules or operation.
        Anyone, anywhere, can use it without permission.
    </p>


    <!-- 2. THE BIG PICTURE -->
    <h2>2. The Big Picture: How a Bitcoin Payment Works</h2>

    <p>
        The overall process of sending and receiving bitcoins can be understood in
        <strong>four key steps</strong>:
    </p>

    <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/ch01/01-02.svg" alt="01 02" width="100%">

            Figure 2. Overview of a Bitcoin payment in four steps.
        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="question">
        Q4: What are the four steps in a typical Bitcoin transaction?
    </p>
    <ol class="answer">
        <li><strong>Create and sign:</strong> Alice makes a transaction that instructs
            1 BTC to go to Bob’s address. She signs it digitally using her private key.</li>
        <li><strong>Broadcast to network:</strong> The transaction is sent out to
            Bitcoin nodes. Each node checks if Alice has enough funds and if her
            signature is valid.</li>
        <li><strong>Add to blockchain:</strong> Miners bundle valid transactions into
            a <em>block</em> and append it to the blockchain (the ledger of all
            transactions).</li>
        <li><strong>Notify wallets:</strong> Bob’s wallet sees that the transaction has
            been included, and confirms that he received 1 BTC.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="question">
        Q5: What is the <em>blockchain</em>?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        The blockchain is an <strong>append-only</strong> database or ledger
        shared by all nodes. It stores every Bitcoin transaction ever made in
        blocks that are cryptographically linked.
    </p>

    <p class="question">
        Q6: Who gets to add new blocks to the blockchain?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        Special nodes called <strong>miners</strong> try to solve a difficult
        cryptographic puzzle. Whichever miner solves it first creates a new block
        and is rewarded with newly minted bitcoins plus any transaction fees from
        the block.
    </p>


    <!-- 3. PROBLEMS WITH TRADITIONAL MONEY -->
    <h2>3. Problems With Traditional Money</h2>

    <p>
        Bitcoin tries to address several issues found in today's financial systems.
    </p>

    <p class="question">
        Q7: What are four major problems that Bitcoin aims to solve?
    </p>
    <ul class="answer">
        <li><strong>Segregation:</strong> Many people lack bank access due to cost,
            documentation, or discrimination.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy issues:</strong> Traditional electronic payments can be
            traced, censored, or frozen by centralized parties.</li>
        <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Many national currencies suffer from
            inflation or even hyperinflation if too much money is printed.</li>
        <li><strong>Borders:</strong> Moving value across countries is often slow,
            expensive, or restricted.</li>
    </ul>

    </div>


    <!-- 4. THE BITCOIN APPROACH -->
    <h2>4. The Bitcoin Approach</h2>

    <p class="question">
        Q8: How does Bitcoin address these problems?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        Bitcoin’s design rests on three pillars:
    </p>
    <ul class="answer">
        <li><strong>Decentralized:</strong> No single point of control means
            no censorship or forced exclusion.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited supply:</strong> Only 21 million bitcoins will
            ever be created, resisting the inflation found in fiat currencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Borderless:</strong> Anyone with an internet connection
            can transact globally, often at lower fees than traditional methods.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- 5. HOW IS BITCOIN USED? -->
    <h2>5. Real-World Use Cases</h2>

    <p class="question">
        Q9: What are common scenarios where Bitcoin is actually used?
    </p>
    <ul class="answer">
        <li><strong>Savings:</strong> You can store bitcoins securely using
            private keys. Some users treat Bitcoin like digital gold.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-border payments:</strong> Faster and potentially cheaper
            than services like Western Union, especially where local banking is weak.</li>
        <li><strong>Shopping:</strong> Online stores (and some physical shops)
            accept Bitcoin to avoid credit card fees or risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Speculation:</strong> Due to its volatility, some people
            buy/sell bitcoins hoping for profit.</li>
        <li><strong>Noncurrency uses:</strong> Using Bitcoin’s blockchain for
            ownership records or proof-of-existence of documents.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/ch01/01-12.svg" alt="01 12" width="75%">
        <div class="figure-caption">

        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="question">
        Q10: When might Bitcoin <em>not</em> be ideal?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        Bitcoin transactions can incur relatively high fees (especially for
        tiny amounts), and confirmations can be slow (about 10 minutes or more).
        Also, security demands can be a challenge for new users, and price
        volatility remains a factor.
    </p>


    <!-- 6. OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES -->
    <h2>6. Other Cryptocurrencies (Alt-coins)</h2>

    <p class="question">
        Q11: Are there alternatives to Bitcoin?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        Yes. There are many “alt-coins” (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Monero, Zcash) that
        introduce unique features like complex smart contracts or enhanced privacy.
        However, Bitcoin remains the largest and most established.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Ethereum</b>: Focuses on running decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. However, it
                is highly centralized, with a small group of developers controlling its direction. Its supply schedule
                has been random and not auditable, and verifying its blockchain is too resource-intensive for
                individuals - leaving control to a handful of powerful validators. Overall, its security and
                architecture are far inferior to Bitcoin.</li>
            <li><b>Monero</b>: Emphasizes privacy and anonymity, but is also centralized, lacks Bitcoin’s robust
                security, and remains vulnerable to a small group of developers who control its direction.
            </li>
            <li><b>Solana</b>: Aims to provide high throughput and speed, but is extremely centralized, has experienced
                multiple outages, and relies on powerful hardware - placing control in the hands of a few large
                validators rather than a decentralized network.</li>
            <li><b>Zcash</b>: Focuses on privacy through different cryptographic techniques. It is also governed by a
                tight-knit team of developers, and its lack of widespread adoption and decentralization make it far less
                secure and trustless than Bitcoin.
            </li>
            <li><b>Namecoin</b>: Used for decentralized domain name registration, but it has failed to gain significant
                traction and is largely controlled by a few entities.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Buyer Beware: Unlike Bitcoin, which is decentralized and secure, most altcoins are technically unsound,
        centralized, and controlled by a handful of people or organizations. They often serve as a means for developers
        to dump premined tokens on unsuspecting buyers, making them risky investments. Bitcoin remains the only
        cryptocurrency with a proven track record of decentralization, security, and sound architecture.

        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="question">
        Q12: Why is Bitcoin's “network effect” important?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        The more people use a currency, the more <em>useful</em> it becomes.
        This effect makes it hard for new coins to challenge Bitcoin unless they
        offer significant improvements or specialized features.
