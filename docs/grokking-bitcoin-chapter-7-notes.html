<h1>Study Notes: Chapter 7 – Proof of Work</h1>

<!-- 1. MULTIPLE MINERS / REPLACING LISA -->
<h2>1. From Lisa to Multiple Miners</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q1: Why is relying on one “Lisa” problematic with respect to transaction censorship?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  With one single miner (Lisa), that miner becomes a central authority 
  who can censor transactions, for example, refusing to include 
  payments for cookies. Multiple miners allow a user to send 
  transactions to <em>any</em> of them, making censorship much harder.
</p>

<p class="question">
  Q2: How do we replace Lisa’s single authority with multiple block producers?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  By letting <strong>anybody</strong> become a miner. Each miner competes to 
  produce the next block, so no single person can decide unilaterally 
  what transactions to include.

<!-- 2. LUCKY NUMBERS VS. PROOF OF WORK -->
<h2>2. Lucky Numbers vs. Proof of Work</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q3: What was the "lucky number" approach, and why was it naive?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  The lucky number approach had each miner pick random numbers hoping 
  to “draw” a low-enough number to publish a block. It was naive because 
  no one could prove the miner was being honest in its number drawing. 
  Cheating was undetectable.
</p>

<p class="question">
  Q4: What does proof of work do differently?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  Instead of trusting random-number drawing, miners must find a block 
  header whose double SHA256 <em>hash</em> is below a certain <strong>target</strong>. 
  Verifiers can easily confirm a valid block header by re-hashing. 
  It's proof the miner did the required (hard) work.

  </div>
</div>


<!-- 3. DIFFICULTY & TARGET ADJUSTMENTS -->
<h2>3. Difficulty and Target Adjustments</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q5: Why do we need to adjust the proof-of-work target every so often?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  More miners join, or miners add more hardware, changing the total 
  hashrate. If hashrate grows, blocks are found too quickly, accelerating 
  money creation. Difficulty adjustments keep the block time ~10 minutes.
</p>

<p class="question">
  Q6: How is the new target calculated?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  After each 2,016-block period (“retarget period”), the protocol 
  checks how long that period took compared to the intended two weeks 
  (14 days). It adjusts the target proportionally (with limits of ×4 or ÷4 
  at most) to bring the block production rate back to ~10 minutes.
</p>

<!-- 4. REORG, FORKS, AND SPLITS -->
<h2>4. Splits, Forks, and the Strongest Chain</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q7: How do miners occasionally produce blocks on different branches?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  Sometimes two miners find a valid proof of work at nearly the same 
  time. Each publishes its block. Now there are two valid blocks at 
  the same height—a <em>split</em>.
</p>

<p class="question">
  Q8: How is such a split resolved?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  Eventually another block is found and published atop one of these 
  competing blocks. Whichever branch becomes longer (or has the most 
  accumulated proof of work) is accepted by all miners. The shorter 
  branch is abandoned (“becomes stale”).
</p>


<!-- 5. DOUBLE-SPEND ATTACKS & SECURITY -->
<h2>5. Security: Double-Spend Attacks</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q9: How can a miner with some hashrate attempt a double spend?</p>
<p class="answer">
  By secretly creating a competing chain containing a conflicting 
  transaction. Once the victim sees confirmations on the honest chain 
  and hands over goods, the attacker tries to release the secret 
  chain that excludes (or conflicts with) the honest transaction, 
  reversing it.
</p>

<p class="question">
  Q10: Why do merchants wait for multiple confirmations?</p>
<p class="answer">
  The more blocks confirm a transaction, the harder it is for an attacker 
  to produce a stronger private chain from that transaction's ancestor 
  block onward—especially if the attacker has < 50% of the total hashrate.
</p>

</div>


<!-- 6. TRANSACTION FEES & INCENTIVES -->
<h2>6. Transaction Fees and Miners' Incentives</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q11: Why do transactions include fees?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  <ul>
    <li>To reward miners for including them (offsetting the risk of losing 
        the “block race” by having a bigger block).</li>
    <li>To compete against other transactions for limited block space 
        (a fee market).</li>
    <li>Eventually, when block subsidies drop to zero, fees become the 
        main incentive to keep miners mining.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p class="question">
  Q12: How does a miner collect these transaction fees?</p>
<p class="answer">
  By adding them to the coinbase transaction. The total output of the 
  coinbase is the block subsidy (newly minted) plus the sum of all 
  transactions' fees in that block.
</p>


<!-- 7. CONCLUSIONS -->
<h2>7. Conclusions / Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Multiple Miners / Proof of Work:</strong> Replaces one central authority 
      with many potential block producers, improving censorship resistance.</li>
  <li><strong>Competing to Produce Blocks:</strong> Each miner hashes the block 
      header until the result is below a dynamic target, proving 
      they did costly work.</li>
  <li><strong>Difficulty Adjustments:</strong> Every 2,016 blocks (~2 weeks) 
      the target recalibrates based on actual block production time 
      to maintain ~10 min intervals.</li>
  <li><strong>Forks & Splits:</strong> Occur when two blocks are found simultaneously. 
      Eventually, one becomes the strongest chain (most proof of work), 
      invalidating the other.</li>
  <li><strong>Security & Double-Spends:</strong> Miners below 50% of the hashrate 
      have a diminishing probability of reversing many confirmations. 
      Waiting for multiple confirmations lowers double-spend risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Fees as Incentives:</strong> Transactions pay fees so miners 
      have reason to include them, preventing censorship and compensating 
      miners as the block subsidy decreases over time.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p><em>End of Study Notes for Chapter 7. We now have a decentralized 
proof-of-work mining system where miners compete to produce blocks 
and collect rewards, making transaction censorship much harder!</em></p>
