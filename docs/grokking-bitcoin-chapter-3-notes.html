<h1>Study Notes: Chapter 3 – Addresses</h1>

<!-- INTRO & MOTIVATION -->
<h2>1. Why Replace Names With Addresses?</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q1: Why can using names in our ledger (or spreadsheet) be a privacy problem?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  Because outsiders (like an insurance company) could identify who is sending 
  and receiving. They could see how many cookies (or how many bitcoins) someone 
  is spending. It compromises personal and financial privacy.
</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q2: How does replacing names help?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  Instead of names, the spreadsheet will list only public key information. 
  That way, transactions appear like “<code>PublicKey_A</code> to <code>PublicKey_B</code>,” 
  making it harder to see who is who.
</p>


<!-- REPLACING NAMES WITH PUBLIC KEYS (PKHs) -->
<h2>2. Public Keys, Public Key Hashes, and Addresses</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q3: After dropping personal names, what do we store in the spreadsheet instead?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  We store <strong>public key hashes (PKHs)</strong>. Each public key is first hashed 
  with SHA256, then hashed again with RIPEMD160, resulting in a 20-byte PKH.
</p>

<div class="figure">
  <img src="images/ch03/03-06.svg" alt="03 06" width="100%">
  <div class="figure-caption">
    Figure 6. The public key is hashed first with SHA256, then RIPEMD160, to produce a PKH.
  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q4: Why shorten public keys to 20-byte PKHs?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Smaller size:</strong> A 160-bit PKH is smaller than a 33-byte public key, 
      saving storage space in the ledger.</li>
    <li><strong>Extra security:</strong> If there’s ever a vulnerability in the public key 
      derivation, hashing adds another protective layer.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p class="question">
  Q5: Does replacing names with PKHs solve all privacy concerns?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  Not entirely. PKHs are pseudonyms, but any link between a PKH and its 
  real owner can still reveal someone's entire transaction history. 
  So it's better, for privacy, to use multiple PKHs (or addresses).
</p>


<!-- TYPING ERRORS & ADDRESSES -->
<h2>3. Avoiding Costly Typing Errors With Addresses</h2>

<p>
  Typing a 20-byte PKH by hand can be error-prone. A single character 
  mistake can send funds into the void. Enter <strong>Bitcoin addresses</strong> 
  (or <em>cookie token addresses</em>), which include a checksum.
</p>

<p class="question">
  Q6: What is a Bitcoin (cookie token) address in this analogy?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  It’s the PKH plus:
  <ul>
    <li>A <em>version byte</em> (often 0x00) at the start.</li>
    <li>A 4-byte checksum at the end to detect typos.</li>
    <li>Encoded in <strong>base58check</strong> to avoid confusing characters and 
      to make addresses more user-friendly.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

  <div class="figure-caption">

  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q7: How does base58check encoding help reduce errors?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Checksum:</strong> A 4-byte checksum (from double-SHA256) detects 
      most typos. If the address is misspelled, the checksum won’t match.</li>
    <li><strong>Short alphabet:</strong> It excludes look-alike characters like 
      <code>0</code> (zero) vs. <code>O</code> (capital O), reducing confusion.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

</div>


<!-- USING MULTIPLE ADDRESSES -->
<h2>4. Boosting Privacy by Using Multiple Addresses</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q8: Can Acme Insurances still track your cookie-eating if they identify 
  your PKH or address just once?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  Potentially yes. Once they match your PKH to you, they see all your 
  spreadsheet activity tied to that PKH. But if you frequently use new 
  PKHs or addresses, it’s harder to link them all to you.
</p>

  <div class="figure-caption">
    Figure 1. Addresses (PKHs) help with privacy, but using new addresses per payment 
    is even more private.
  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q9: Is there any drawback to using many addresses?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  It can be a bit more complex to manage, but modern wallet software 
  automates generating new addresses and keeping track of them, 
  improving privacy and security.
</p>


<!-- SUMMARY & KEY TAKEAWAYS -->
<h2>5. Key Takeaways / Summary</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Replacing names:</strong> The spreadsheet or ledger now uses public key 
      hashes instead of personal names.</li>
  <li><strong>PKH creation:</strong> Public key → SHA256 → RIPEMD160 → 20-byte PKH 
      reduces size and adds a layer of security.</li>
  <li><strong>Addresses (Base58check):</strong> User-friendly format with a version byte 
      and a 4-byte checksum to prevent loss of funds through typos.</li>
  <li><strong>Network vs. Users:</strong> Lisa (or the Bitcoin network) sees only PKHs. 
      Humans use addresses for safety and ease.</li>
  <li><strong>Privacy remains partial:</strong> PKHs are <em>pseudonymous</em>. Reusing 
      addresses can still link them to one identity, so best practice 
      is <em>new address per transaction</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>End of Study Notes for Chapter 3. You now understand how Bitcoin addresses 
(PKH + base58check) reduce errors and improve privacy over using names 
or raw public keys!</em></p>
