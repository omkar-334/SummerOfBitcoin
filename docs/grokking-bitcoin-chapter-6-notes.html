<h1>Study Notes: Chapter 6 – The Blockchain</h1>

<!-- 1. NEED FOR BLOCKCHAIN -->
<h2>1. Why a Blockchain Instead of a Spreadsheet?</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q1: What limitation did the old spreadsheet-based system still have?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  Lisa could silently <em>delete</em> or revert transactions without verifiers 
  being able to prove it. Although users could confirm the validity of 
  transactions, they couldn't prove Lisa hadn't removed any 
  after the fact.
</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q2: How does a blockchain help if Lisa tries to remove or replace transactions?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  Each block references the previous block’s ID (hash) and signs a 
  "merkle root" of its transactions, so tampering would invalidate 
  signatures in that block and all subsequent blocks. This makes fraud 
  cryptographically provable.
</p>


<!-- 2. BLOCKCHAIN BASICS -->
<h2>2. Building the Blockchain</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q3: What is a "block" in the blockchain?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  A block is a file containing:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Block header</strong>: 
      - The previous block's hash, 
      - The merkle root of current transactions, 
      - A timestamp, 
      - A block signature (or proof of work in Bitcoin).</li>
    <li><strong>Transactions</strong> included in this block.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

  <div class="figure-caption">
    Figure 4. Each block references the previous block, forming a chain.
  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q4: How does the block header "commit" to all transactions in the block?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  Through the <em>merkle root</em>, which is a single hash derived from 
  recursively hashing all transactions in a merkle tree. Changing any 
  transaction changes the merkle root, invalidating the block.
</p>


<!-- 3. LISA'S ROLE AND SIGNING BLOCKS -->
<h2>3. Lisa's Role in Creating Blocks</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q5: What are the steps Lisa takes to create (confirm) a new block?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Create a block template:</strong> gather unconfirmed transactions, 
      form the merkle root, reference the previous block’s ID, 
      and set a timestamp.</li>
    <li><strong>Sign the block header:</strong> using her private key (or proof of work in Bitcoin).</li>
    <li><strong>Publish the block file:</strong> add it to the shared folder (or broadcast over the network).</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<div class="figure">

  <div class="figure-caption">
    Figure 6. Lisa signing a block header.
  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q6: How does this signature help prevent Lisa from removing transactions later?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  If she changes or removes any transaction in a past block, she must 
  alter the block header and re-sign it, creating a new version of that block. 
  Now there are two signed versions of the same height, proving fraud.
</p>


<!-- 4. LIGHTWEIGHT WALLETS (SPV) -->
<h2>4. Lightweight Wallets (SPV)</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q7: Why do some wallets prefer not to download the full blockchain?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  For bandwidth and storage reasons. Mobile or low-capacity devices 
  often use "lightweight" or SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) wallets 
  that trust a full node to filter and provide relevant transaction data.
</p>

<div class="figure">
  <img src="images/ch06/06-15.svg" alt="06 15" width="75%">
  <div class="figure-caption">
    Figure 15. Lightweight wallets connect to a full node (or multiple nodes) for relevant data.
  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q8: How do lightweight wallets verify that a transaction is in a block 
  without downloading the full block?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  They use a <strong>merkle proof</strong>. The full node sends:
  <ul>
    <li>The block header (with merkle root)</li>
    <li>A partial merkle tree</li>
    <li>The actual transactions in question</li>
  </ul>
  The wallet reconstructs the merkle path and checks if it matches 
  the block’s merkle root.
</p>


<!-- 5. BLOOM FILTERS & PRIVACY -->
<h2>5. Bloom Filters & SPV Privacy</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q9: How do bloom filters help preserve privacy while fetching relevant transactions?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  A bloom filter is a bit array that matches multiple addresses with some 
  probability. The wallet sends this filter to the full node, which checks 
  if various parts of each transaction match the filter. Because it can 
  produce false positives, the node can’t tell exactly which addresses 
  the wallet is interested in.
</p>

  <img src="images/ch06/06-17.svg" alt="06 17" width="100%">
  <div class="figure-caption">
    Figure 17. Creating a bloom filter for multiple addresses.
  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q10: What are the downsides of bloom filters?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Privacy leaks:</strong> With enough queries or analysis, the node 
        can often deduce which addresses belong together.</li>
    <li><strong>Load on full nodes:</strong> They must scan large sections of the blockchain, 
        potentially causing DoS vulnerabilities.</li>
  </ul>
</p>


<!-- 6. MERKLE TREES & MERKLE PROOFS -->
<h2>6. Merkle Trees & Verifying Transaction Inclusion</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q11: What is a merkle tree in this context?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  A binary tree of hash pairs that merges all transaction hashes into a 
  single "merkle root". Each transaction is hashed, then concatenated 
  pairwise, hashed again, and so on until only one hash remains.
</p>

<div class="figure">
  <img src="images/ch06/06-23.svg" alt="06 23" width="75%">
  <div class="figure-caption">
    Figure 23. Constructing the merkle root from four transactions.
  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q12: Why not just hash all transactions in one big concatenation?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  A tree structure allows selective proofs (partial merkle proofs) for 
  only a subset of transactions, without revealing or sending the entire 
  block of transactions. This saves a lot of data.
</p>


<!-- 7. REMAINING LIMITS ON LISA -->
<h2>7. Are We Fully Trustless Now?</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q13: Can Lisa still cheat in any way despite the blockchain preventing removal or alteration?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  She can still <em>censor</em> transactions by refusing to include them in blocks. 
  She also controls which transactions appear at all. Additionally, 
  she can revert old transactions by building alternative blocks 
  (though that reveals her fraud if the blocks are already distributed).
</p>

<div class="figure">
  <img src="images/ch06/06-13.svg" alt="06 13" width="100%">
  <div class="figure-caption">
    Figure 13. Changing old blocks requires rebuilding and re-signing all subsequent blocks.
  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q14: What’s next for removing Lisa’s power to censor and controlling who builds blocks?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  We introduce <strong>miners</strong> and <strong>proof of work</strong> in Chapter 7, 
  distributing the block-building process among many nodes so no single 
  party can decide unilaterally which transactions to include.
</p>


<!-- 8. SUMMARY / KEY TAKEAWAYS -->
<h2>8. Key Takeaways / Summary</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Blockchain Replaces Spreadsheet:</strong> Blocks are chained via 
      hashes; tampering one block invalidates all subsequent blocks.</li>
  <li><strong>Merkle Trees:</strong> Efficiently commits to all transactions 
      while allowing lightweight proofs for partial sets of transactions.</li>
  <li><strong>Lightweight Wallets (SPV):</strong> Save bandwidth by only 
      downloading block headers + merkle proofs. They trust 
      full nodes for full transaction validation.</li>
  <li><strong>Bloom Filters:</strong> Provide an obfuscated way to request 
      relevant transactions, at the expense of partial privacy leaks 
      and heavier node load.</li>
  <li><strong>Remaining Trust in Lisa:</strong> She can’t delete transactions 
      but can still censor them. Proof of work (next chapter) 
      removes single-authority control.</li>
  <li><strong>Security vs. Convenience:</strong> Running your own full node 
      is the only guaranteed way to verify the rules you want; 
      SPV wallets must trust one or more nodes.</li>
</ul>

with a blockchain, ensuring public verifiability of the transaction 
history and paving the way for decentralized consensus in the upcoming chapters!</em></p>
