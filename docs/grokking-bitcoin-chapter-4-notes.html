<h1>Study Notes: Chapter 4 – Wallets</h1>

<!-- 1. WALLET BASICS -->
<h2>1. Why Do We Need a Wallet?</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q1: What is a wallet in the context of Bitcoin (or cookie tokens)?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  A <em>wallet</em> is a software application that generates and stores your 
  private keys, creates addresses, facilitates payments, and keeps track 
  of your funds. It does not store the money itself (that’s in the blockchain 
  or spreadsheet) but holds the keys to spend it.
</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q2: What common tasks should a wallet handle?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  <ul>
    <li>Create new addresses (and manage the corresponding private keys)</li>
    <li>Transfer payment details easily (avoid typing errors using QR codes, etc.)</li>
    <li>Send signed payment requests (transactions) to the ledger</li>
    <li>Track balances of each address</li>
    <li>Back up private keys so users don’t lose funds</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>2. First Wallet Version & Key Features</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q3: How does the wallet improve the user experience compared to emailing Lisa manually?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  The wallet automates most steps: it handles address creation, 
  digital signatures, and prepares the payment details (amount, recipient address) 
  for the user. It also updates balances automatically by checking the spreadsheet/ledger.
</p>

<!-- 3. PRIVATE KEY BACKUPS -->
<h2>3. Backing Up Private Keys</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q4: Why do we need to back up our private keys?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  Because losing your private keys means permanently losing access to your funds. 
  The ledger (spreadsheet/blockchain) won’t care who lost a key; it only checks 
  digital signatures.
</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q5: What are some initial (but imperfect) solutions for backing up private keys?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  <ul>
    <li>Automatically emailing a backup whenever a new address is created 
        (too frequent, risk of theft)</li>
    <li>Pre-creating a batch of addresses, then making a single backup 
        (less frequent, but still many backups)</li>
    <li>Encrypting backups with a password (solves theft issues but adds 
        password risks, potential forgetting, etc.)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p class="question">
  Q6: What are the main drawbacks of password-encrypted backups?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  <ul>
    <li>You must secure both the backup file <em>and</em> the password.</li>
    <li>You risk forgetting rarely used passwords.</li>
    <li>As technology advances, brute-forcing older passwords becomes easier.</li>
    <li>Humans often choose weak or guessable passwords.</li>
  </ul>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q7: What is a <em>hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet</em>?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  An HD wallet derives all of its private keys from a single master 
  seed. This seed alone can recreate the entire family (tree) of private 
  keys, enabling a single backup to restore them all.
</p>

<p class="question">
  Q8: Why is this approach so much better for backups?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  You only need to back up <em>once</em> (the seed). Any new addresses 
  derived in the future remain backed up as long as you have that seed. 
  No repeated exports, no repeated backups each time a new key is generated.
</p>

<!-- 5. SEEDS & MNEMONIC SENTENCES -->
<h2>5. Seeds and Mnemonic Sentences (BIP39)</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q9: Instead of storing a hex seed like <code>16432a2077…</code>, how can we make it more human-friendly?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  We use a <strong>mnemonic sentence</strong> of 12 or 24 English words. 
  This is easier to write down and verify. The wallet can convert it back 
  into the seed if needed.
</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q10: How does the mnemonic system protect against typos?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  Each mnemonic includes a short checksum (several bits), so if the user 
  writes down incorrect words, there’s a high chance the wallet will detect it 
  when restoring.
</p>


<!-- 6. EXTENDED (XPUB) / (XPRV) KEYS -->
<h2>6. Extended Public (XPUB) and Private (XPRV) Keys</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q11: What is an xprv and how does it differ from a normal private key?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  An xprv (extended private key) contains two parts:
  <ul>
    <li>The private key itself</li>
    <li>A <em>chain code</em> (256 bits of extra "entropy")</li>
  </ul>
  This setup allows generating child keys (and child chain codes) in a 
  hierarchical fashion.
</p>

<div class="figure">
  <img src="images/ch04/04-19.svg" alt="04 19" width="50%">
  <div class="figure-caption">
    Figure 19. An xpub has a public key + a chain code; an xprv has a private key + a chain code
  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q12: What about xpub (extended public key)?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  Similarly, an xpub is the public key + chain code. With an xpub, you can 
  generate new addresses (child public keys), but cannot spend funds because 
  you don’t have the private keys.
</p>

<p class="question">
  Q13: Why is xpub so useful on insecure servers?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  A web server can generate many fresh receiving addresses using the xpub 
  (no private keys needed), so even if the server is hacked, the attacker 
  cannot steal funds—it only exposes public info.
</p>


<!-- 7. HARDENED KEY DERIVATION -->
<h2>7. Hardened Key Derivation</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q14: What's the risk if someone has a normal child private key <strong>and</strong> 
  the parent xpub?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  They can potentially compute the entire parent xprv (and thus spend all 
  other child keys in that branch). This is because normal derivation 
  uses standard math that can be reversed with these two pieces of info.
</p>

<div class="figure">
  <img src="images/ch04/04-24.svg" alt="04 24" width="75%">
  <div class="figure-caption">
    Figure 24. Hardened child derivation uses the parent private key in the hash, 
    preventing someone with the child private key and the parent xpub from 
    calculating the parent private key.
  </div>
</div>

<p class="question">
  Q15: How does hardened derivation fix that?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  Hardened derivation uses the <em>parent private key</em> in the hash instead of 
  the parent public key. That way, the child private key cannot be reversed 
  from the xpub.
</p>


<!-- 8. PUBLIC KEY MATH -->
<h2>8. Public Key Math (Optional Deep Dive)</h2>

<p class="question">
  Q16: What is the elliptic curve used in Bitcoin, and why is it secure?
</p>
<p class="answer">
  Bitcoin uses the secp256k1 elliptic curve <code>y^2 = x^3 + 7 (mod p)</code>. 
  It's secure because there's no known efficient "inverse" for the 
  multiplication operation that maps a private key to a public key.

<!-- 9. SUMMARY -->
<h2>9. Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Wallets</strong> manage private keys, create new addresses, handle backups, 
      and automate the signing process so users don't have to do it manually.</li>
  <li><strong>HD Wallets (BIP32/BIP44):</strong> All private keys are derived from 
      a single master seed, ensuring simpler backups (only need to keep 
      that seed safe).</li>
  <li><strong>Mnemonic (BIP39):</strong> A set of words to represent the seed. 
      Easier to write down than raw hex. Includes a short checksum 
      to detect typos.</li>
  <li><strong>XPUB & XPRV:</strong> Extended public/private keys which each contain 
      a chain code. This allows hierarchical generation of addresses.</li>
  <li><strong>Hardened derivation:</strong> Protects an entire branch of keys from 
      being compromised if a single child private key is leaked along with 
      the parent xpub.</li>
  <li><strong>Online shops & xpub:</strong> Merchants can generate addresses 
      without holding private keys on their web servers.</li>
</ul>
